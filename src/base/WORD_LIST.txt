Statistical Trends measure if certain grid cells contain more MPs than we would expect if they were assigned at random.  The 'z' (e.g. z = 2.5) value shows how many standard deviations the number of MPs vary from the mean number of expected MPs. The range (e.g. 84 - 114) is the 95% confidence interval for the number of MPs. If the actual number is outside this range, the probability that the trend is random is <5%.
